# What I'm Doing Now

This is my "now page" - a snapshot of what I'm focusing on at this point in my life.

## Current Focus
- Working on improving the 3rd iteration of my personal blog
- Reading "The Bitcoin Standard" by Saifedean Ammous
- [Kindle Jailbreaking](https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/WinterBreak/) and installed [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks) on Kindle PW
