## Introduction

I get vocal for a few issues that I've not been able to tolerate. Most of the time it'd end up as verbal diarrhoea. This time I’m making a conscious choice to put it into words. I’d like to think that I’m fairly conscious about the functioning of my body, it’s likes and dislikes. Maybe circa May 2022, I started becoming hyper sensitive of the noise pollution that was rampant in Chennai.

## The Problem with Horns

Let’s start with the horn manufacturers, truck & bus drivers.

What is it with them? I start raging out everytime one of <insert above list> would be made next to me. It really feels like we're totally on auto-pilot mode on the road with a horrible set of defaults. The incessent need to honk as soon as the signal turns green and the mindless honking in general for a gazillion needless reasons.

We really need to be more awake on the road is what it feels like. I've been using the flash/pass lights instead of honking most of the times. I'd like for the BS(iykyk?) auto regulations to be more imposing on the types of horns, the decible level limit and the intolerable rythms they all have(projecting frustrations).

## The Impact of Noise

I'm pretty sure you'd remember times when you felt at least a quarter of the rage in your own city in India. I've read through a lot of articles on how noise causes a lot of imbalance in our mind and body. My apple watch tells me that I run the risk of permanently getting my hearing affected if I'm around the noise almost every single day whenever I’m on the road. Sigh. 

A lot of y'all would just end up using noise cancelling headphones and go about your day.

## Alternative Solutions

My friend and I were talking once and he said "imagine a place where when we honk, the sound is produced from our own vocal chords(makes for a good rick & morty episode I suppose haha)" and ended up with a funny scene and laughed about it. How would that be? Would we really be “honking” as much? Probably not. Would we still travel safely and harmoniously? I'd like to think so.
